# Scripts Folder Analysis for CircleCI

## Essential Scripts (Required for CI/CD)

### ‚ùå None are directly required by CircleCI
Your current CircleCI configuration runs all commands inline and doesn't depend on any scripts in the `scripts/` folder for core functionality.

## Current CircleCI Usage
```yaml
# Only sets permissions but doesn't use the scripts
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

## Script Categories

### üîß Manual Deployment Helper Scripts
- `deploy-complete.sh` - Full manual deployment
- `deploy-to-existing-cluster.sh` - Deploy to existing cluster
- `fix-deployment.sh` - Manual deployment fixes
- `verify-deployment.sh` - Post-deployment verification

### üêò Database Management Scripts  
- `fix-postgres.sh` - Fix PostgreSQL volume mount issues
- `init-db.sh` - Database initialization

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure Scripts
- `fix-ebs-csi-permissions.sh` - EBS CSI driver setup for gp3 storage
- `manage-secrets.sh` - Secret management utilities

### üèóÔ∏è Build Scripts
- `build-production.sh` - Production build (replaced by inline Dockerfile commands)

## Recommendation: Clean Up

### Keep These (Useful for manual operations):
- `fix-postgres.sh` - Fixes common PostgreSQL deployment issue
- `deploy-complete.sh` - Useful for manual deployments
- `verify-deployment.sh` - Deployment health checks

### Can Remove These:
- `build-production.sh` - Dockerfile now uses inline commands
- `deployment-verification.sh` - Duplicate of verify-deployment.sh
- `fix-deployment.sh` - Replaced by deploy-complete.sh
- `deploy-to-existing-cluster.sh` - Redundant with main deployment

### Optional (Infrastructure):
- `fix-ebs-csi-permissions.sh` - Only needed for gp3 storage upgrade
- `manage-secrets.sh` - Only if you need secret automation
- `init-db.sh` - CircleCI handles database initialization

## Updated CircleCI Suggestion

Remove the script permissions since CircleCI doesn't use them:

```yaml
- run:
    name: Run tests
    command: |
      chmod +x test.sh
      mkdir -p test-results
      ./test.sh
```

This removes unnecessary script permission setting and focuses on what CircleCI actually needs.
