# Critical Issues Found Between CircleCI and K8s/Helm

## üö® Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Label Selector Alignment
**Problem**: CircleCI expects `deployment/devops-hilltop-app` but k8s manifests used different labels
**Fixed**: Updated k8s/deployment.yaml and k8s/service.yaml to use `app: devops-hilltop-app`

### 2. Helm Image Repository Mismatch  
**Problem**: Helm values.yaml used `devops-hilltop:latest` (missing registry)
**Fixed**: Updated to `hilltopconsultancy/devops-hilltop:latest` with `imagePullPolicy: Always`

### 3. Service Type Configuration
**Problem**: Helm used NodePort, but CircleCI expects LoadBalancer
**Fixed**: Changed Helm service to LoadBalancer with AWS annotations

### 4. Database Command Issues
**Status**: `npm run db:push` exists ‚úì but container needs Drizzle CLI available

## üîç Remaining Issues

### Missing Helm PostgreSQL Integration
- k8s/ uses separate postgres-deployment.yaml with manual secrets
- Helm values.yaml defines postgresql but templates don't include it
- Need to align PostgreSQL configuration between k8s and Helm approaches

### CircleCI LoadBalancer Reference
- CircleCI checks `devops-hilltop-service` but actual service name is correct
- LoadBalancer hostname extraction works with current setup

### Database Initialization in Production
- `kubectl exec deployment/devops-hilltop-app -- npm run db:push` assumes Drizzle CLI in container
- Production container needs drizzle-kit available for migrations

## üìã Next Steps Required

1. **Choose deployment method**: Use either k8s manifests OR Helm (not both)
2. **Fix PostgreSQL approach**: Align database deployment between k8s/Helm
3. **Verify Drizzle CLI**: Ensure production container has migration tools
4. **Test complete pipeline**: Validate CircleCI ‚Üí k8s deployment flow

## üéØ Recommendation

Standardize on **k8s manifests** since CircleCI is already configured for them:
- Keep k8s/ directory as primary deployment method
- Use Helm as optional alternative for different environments
- Ensure consistent labeling and naming across all manifests
