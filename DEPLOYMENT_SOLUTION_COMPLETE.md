# DevOps Hilltop - Complete Deployment Solution

## Docker Build Issue Resolved

The original error occurred because the build script path was incorrect in the Docker container. Fixed by replacing the script call with direct build commands in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Build the application with proper exclusions
RUN npm run build
RUN npx esbuild server/production-entry.ts \
  --platform=node \
  --packages=external \
  --bundle \
  --format=esm \
  --outfile=dist/server.js \
  --define:process.env.NODE_ENV="production"
```

This creates a clean 17.1kb production server bundle without any Vite dependencies.

## Complete Pipeline Verification

### CircleCI Configuration
- **Test Phase**: Jest with JUnit XML reporting
- **Build Phase**: Docker images with Git SHA tags
- **Deploy Staging**: k8s manifest deployment with rolling updates
- **Deploy Production**: Scaled deployment with LoadBalancer verification

### Kubernetes Resources Aligned
- **Labels**: All resources use `app: devops-hilltop-app` for consistency
- **Images**: `hilltopconsultancy/devops-hilltop` with `imagePullPolicy: Always`
- **Services**: LoadBalancer with AWS annotations for external access
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with gp2 persistent storage

### Helm Charts Updated
- **Image Repository**: Corrected to `hilltopconsultancy/devops-hilltop`
- **Service Type**: Changed from NodePort to LoadBalancer
- **Annotations**: AWS LoadBalancer configuration included
- **Dependencies**: Aligned with k8s manifest specifications

### Production Container Features
- **Entry Point**: `node dist/server.js` (no Vite dependencies)
- **Migration Support**: drizzle-kit included for database initialization
- **Security**: Non-root user with proper file permissions
- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint for Kubernetes probes

## Deployment Commands

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Complete deployment with verification
./scripts/deploy-complete.sh

# Verification only
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
```

### CircleCI Pipeline
- **Staging**: Push to `develop` branch
- **Production**: Push to `main` branch (requires approval)

### Alternative Helm Deployment
```bash
helm upgrade --install devops-hilltop ./helm/devops-hilltop -n devops-hilltop
```

## Health Verification

The deployment includes comprehensive health checks:
- Container health endpoints
- Database connectivity verification
- LoadBalancer external IP assignment
- Pod readiness and liveness probes

## Production Ready

All critical issues have been resolved:
- Docker build works with direct commands
- CircleCI and k8s configurations are aligned
- Database migrations function in production containers
- LoadBalancer provides external access
- Monitoring stack deploys with the application

The platform is ready for production deployment on AWS EKS with full CI/CD automation.
