# LoadBalancer Service Pending Status Fix

## Problem Analysis
Your LoadBalancer service is stuck in `<pending>` state because:
1. AWS Load Balancer Controller lacks proper IAM permissions
2. Missing OIDC provider trust relationship for the service account
3. Controller may not be running or properly configured

## Current Status
```
devops-hilltop-service   LoadBalancer   10.100.156.128   <pending>     80:31183/TCP   4h25m
```
- Service has valid endpoints: `172.31.12.184:5000,172.31.18.124:5000`
- Pods are running and healthy
- Only the LoadBalancer provisioning is failing

## Solutions

### Option 1: Quick Access (Immediate)
Use NodePort service for immediate application access:
```bash
./scripts/quick-access.sh
```
This creates a NodePort service accessible at port 30080 on your cluster nodes.

### Option 2: Fix LoadBalancer Controller (Production)
Complete IAM setup for AWS Load Balancer Controller:
```bash
./scripts/fix-loadbalancer-controller.sh
```

## What the Fix Does

### IAM Policy Creation
- Creates comprehensive IAM policy with all required LoadBalancer permissions
- Includes EC2, ELB, and security group management permissions
- Handles target group and listener management

### OIDC Trust Relationship
- Establishes trust between EKS cluster and IAM role
- Uses cluster's OIDC issuer for secure service account authentication
- Scoped to kube-system namespace and aws-load-balancer-controller service account

### Controller Deployment
- Updates service account with correct role ARN annotation
- Deploys controller with proper cluster name configuration
- Waits for rollout completion before testing

## Expected Outcome
After running the fix script:
1. LoadBalancer service will provision an AWS NLB
2. External IP will be assigned within 2-3 minutes
3. Application will be accessible via the LoadBalancer's external IP

## Verification
Check LoadBalancer status after fix:
```bash
kubectl get svc devops-hilltop-service -n devops-hilltop -w
```

The service should transition from `<pending>` to showing an actual AWS LoadBalancer DNS name as the EXTERNAL-IP.
